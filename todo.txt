NOTES
> Each room could have a special function value. The special function is loaded from an extending class
> The extending class (one class per game) could add to a set of predefined actions. The class would be loaded  before the commands are processed

> The base class could just cover standard command parsing:
>>> go [direction], head [direction], take [direction]path etc.
>>> use [item]
>>> take [item]

> Expansions from extending class could check name of room and add commands into accepted commands array
> Base class could include function to addRecognisedCommand - it takes the command and the function in the extended class that accepts it
> Base class could also include function to removeRecognisedCommand? eg; remove north, south, east, west to go down into dungeon or up stairs

- TIP - keep outgoing messages short. Very short.

      - I awaken in a dark and gloomy forest. Where am I and what is this place? I feel fearful, a sense of death ahead.
      - There's a troll. He's large and armoured. It will be difficult to pass him, but pass him I must.
      - The troll is down. Falls to the forest floor with a loud deep thud. A pouch has fallen by his side.
      - Made of skin, the pouch contains a single key. Rusted and old, it hasn't been used for a long time. You take it.
      - Swamp. Sinking. Must keep moving. Light on horizon.
      - Uninviting mountains ahead. Dangerous and deadly.
      - Darkness. Damp, damp darkness. Fumbling along slowly.
      - Scratching noise, ahead. Now behind. Getting louder.
      - Evil eyes appear. Rushing at me. I sense death ahead.
      - Creature dead. Pure hatred in those dead eyes. Has pouch.
